<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Network Protocols</h1>
<br /><h2>Objectives</h2>

This project focuses on configuring Network Security Groups (NSGs) in Azure and inspecting network protocols to enhance security. It includes rules setup, traffic monitoring, and protocol analysis. <br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop Connection
- Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 Pro (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Environment Prep</h2>

<br />-Set up two VMs in Azure within the same virtual network.<br />
<br />-Configure one VM with Windows 10 Pro and the other with Ubuntu.<br />
<br />-Use the Windows VM to connect to the Ubuntu VM via command line or PowerShell.<br /> 

<h2>Actions and Steps</h2>

</p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<br />-Connect to the Windows VM via Remote Desktop using its public IP.<br />
<br />-Install Wireshark to begin analyzing network traffic.<br />
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />-Apply a filter for ICMP traffic in Wireshark.<br />
<br />-Open PowerShell and run the ping command to test network communication.<br />
<br />-Test communication with the Ubuntu VM using its private IP and with google.com.<br />
<br />-Initiate a continuous ping to the Ubuntu VM using: ping -t (IP address) to observe network security groups.<br />
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />-Access the networking settings for the Ubuntu VM in the Azure portal.<br />
<br />-Create an inbound security rule to block ICMP traffic.<br />
<br />-Set the rule's priority higher than SSH (300) to ensure it takes precedence.<br /> 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />-Open the Azure portal and configure networking settings for the Ubuntu VM.<br />
<br />-Add an inbound security rule to block ICMP traffic, setting priority above SSH (300).<br />
<br />-Check the Windows VM and confirm ICMP traffic is blocked.<br />
<br />-Modify the rule to allow ICMP traffic.<br />
<br />-Run the continuous ping to ensure it resolves without timeouts.<br />
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />-Examine SSH traffic by logging into the Ubuntu server via PowerShell using the ssh command.<br />
<br />-Filter SSH traffic in Wireshark with tcp.port == 22.<br />
<br />-View session activity in Wireshark, where each command executed on the Ubuntu server is logged.<br />
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />-Filter DNS traffic in Wireshark using udp.port == 53.<br />
<br />-Use the nslookup command to query google.com and disney.com.<br />
<br />-Observe the results of the DNS lookup for these popular sites.<br /> 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />-Filter RDP traffic in Wireshark using tcp.port == 3389.<br />
<br />-Observe continuous traffic as RDP streams live data between the computer and the VM hosted on Azure.<br />
</p>
<br />

<h2>Lessons Learned </h2>

The goal of the lab was to observe how different protocols and ports are used in network communication between devices.
Although the lab didnâ€™t focus on troubleshooting, it provided valuable information.
I learned that troubleshooting requires tools like Wireshark and the command line to understand how traffic flows through network ports and protocols.
I realized that success in troubleshooting depends on both familiarity with the tools and maintaining an inquisitive mindset.
