Setting up Active Directory in Azure requires careful network configuration, including assigning a static IP to the domain controller and enabling ICMP traffic through the Windows Firewall. The core process involves installing Active Directory Domain Services and promoting the server to a domain controller. These steps create a foundation for a functional Active Directory environment in the cloud, paving the way for future expansions and integrations.
